# BioPAL Governance

The purpose of this repository is to formalize the governance process of the BioPAL project.
This document clarifies how decisions are made
and how the various elements of our community interact, including the relationship between
open source collaborative development and work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.

The governance documents are best-viewed at our website: [WEBISTE:TBA]

## Infrastructure for this repository

The content in this repository is hosted online with `github-pages`, and the HTML
files are built with [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org). To build and preview
these documents locally, install the latest version of Jupyter Book with:

```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book.git
```

and build the book with:

```
cd path/to/this/repo
jupyter-book build .
```

The resulting website will be in `_build/html`, which you can explore by opening
any of the `.html` files that are created.
